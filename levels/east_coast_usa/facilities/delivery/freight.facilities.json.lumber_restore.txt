   - Line 38: Add "lumber" to "logisticTypesProvided" array (first item)

   In "port" provider:
   - Line 544: Add "lumber" to "logisticTypesReceived" array (first item)
   - Line 549: Add "lumber" to "logisticTypesReceived" array (second item, after "vehForRecycle")

   In "firwoodSupply" provider:

   - Line 752: Add "lumber" to "logisticTypesReceived" array (first item)

NOTE: The "singleAxleLumberTrailers" and "doubleAxleLumberTrailers" filter references were NOT removed
as they are used for trailer deliveries, not the lumber logistics type itself.
