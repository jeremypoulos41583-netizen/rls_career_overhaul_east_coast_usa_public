Please enjoy my take on Career Mode for the East Coast USA map.
This is still a work in progress and still pretty much in beta mode. I have started a career on this map with nothing but my starter vehicle from WCUSA and made it happen so the economy works well. 
I have added open world (free roam base map) missions to earn vouchers and money AND it will count toward your APM progress. 

Huge thank you to JustinRevs for being so kind and helping spread the word.

Huge shout out Mezitury for creating rally stage missions and helping get the word out about this mod. stay tuned for more FRE's in the future.  

Huge thank you to the Raceless team for the RLS career overhaul and sharing their knowledge to make this possible! All creations are theirs and BeamNG's and I simply added them to this map. To learn how to do so, check out Raceless' Youtube channel and join their discord. 

Any questions, suggestions, bug reports please feel free to reach out to me on patreon and/or discord. :-)
